# `pleasant_grove`
"Pleasant Grove" is a wrapper around `pg`, which is the standard Ruby library for PostgreSQL.  It adds some pleasant convenience features.

For examples of how to use this library, see the `./bin` directory, which contains some ruby scripts for messing about with PostrgeSQL databases.

TODO: Write some actual documentation.
